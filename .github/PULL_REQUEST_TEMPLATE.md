If you PR change some site_configs, please push them at fivefilters/ftr-site-config instead.
I regularly merge the upstream in that repo (so you don't need to duplicate your effort).

If you PR is in one of these categories, go ahead, it's fine:
- adding login information for a site
- changing something in src/ or tests/ folders
